## About Me

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer
Engineering Dept at Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by Prof. Vishal M.
Patel. Prior to this, I graduated from Xidian University with a Bachelor's and
Master's degree. My research interest lies in computer vision and machine
learning, including securing deep neural network performance under distribution
shifts. I have worked as a research intern with Gang Hua at Wormpex AI
Research.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** object detection, deep metric learning, cross-modal retrieval
- **Deep Learning:** adversarial attack and defense

## News

- **[Sept. 2022]** One paper for federated learning is accepted to NeurIPS 2022.
- **[Mar. 2022]** One paper for robust deep metric learning is accepted to CVPR 2022.
- **[Aug. 2021]** I was selected as an "Outstanding Reviewer" for ICCV 2021.
