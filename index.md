## About Me

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the
[Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/)
at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).
I am advised by Prof. [Vishal M. Patel](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vishal-patel/).
Prior to this, I graduated from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's and
Master's degree, and was advised by Prof. [Zhenxing Niu](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenxingniu007/home).
I have worked as a research intern with Dr. [Gang Hua](https://ganghua.org/)
at [Wormpex AI Research](http://research.wormpex.com/).
I have worked with Prof. [Le Wang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lewang) as a research assistant
at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.iair.xjtu.edu.cn/).
My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning,
including securing deep neural network performance under distribution shifts.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** object detection, deep metric learning, cross-modal retrieval
- **Deep Learning:** adversarial attack and defense

## News

- **[Sept. 2022]** One paper for federated learning is accepted to NeurIPS 2022.
- **[Mar. 2022]** One paper for robust deep metric learning is accepted to CVPR 2022.
- **[Aug. 2021]** I was selected as an "Outstanding Reviewer" for ICCV 2021.
